<p>I just finished the book <a href="https://paulakers.net/books/2-second-lean">2 Second Lean: How to Grow People and Build a Fun Lean Culture</a>
and one idea I've incorporated into my daily habits is the <strong>three s</strong> method. This method is a simplification of the <strong>five s</strong> 
method of lean manufacturing.</p>

<p>The book is about a company with more traditional manufacturing focus so I had to adapt the <strong>three s</strong> method to be appropriate for my daily work.
Here's a few things I do every morning to organize myself for the day...</p>

<ol>
    <p>I apply sort, sweep, and standardize things to my physical desk.</p>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>I make sure my mouse mat is properly placed for sitting at my desk.</li>
            <li>Verify that the mouse and keyboard are at the right position and have enough "give" to the cords so I can move them freely.</li>
            <li>Put my phone on the right side of my desk and plug it in if it needs charged.</li>
            <li>Move my microphone to the correct position for talking over Slack or Zoom.</li>
            <li>Remove any soda cans, mugs, or trash from the previous day.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I apply sort, sweep, and standardize things to my virtual desk. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Decide whether I need to keep files on my desktop or delete them. If I keep them I organize them into a projects folder</li>
            <li>Empty the recycle bin</li>
            <li>Close all browser windows. I find that starting fresh is easier than trying to come into the same thought pattern as the day previously</li>
            <li>Delete git branches that are no longer relevant</li>
            <li>Read all emails and delete anything unneeded. I will also unsubscribe from marketing spam or create folders for topics I want to receive</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    This takes me five to ten minutes and sets me up for the next 8-9 hours. I've reduced mental waste by not having to parse the noise of the previous day. 
    I feel more motivated and think clearer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Three S</strong> is a very easy practice to adopt and everyone should incorporate it into their work habits.
