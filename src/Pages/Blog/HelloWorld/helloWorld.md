# Hello World
## 2021/03/01

I've wanted to start a blog for awhile now but with two young children having free time is not an easy task.

But I've done the impossible and accomplished a feat of strength.

This is my first blog post (ever) and I'm just going to use this to post random thoughts about anything (but likely mostly tech stuff).

I've been told by my wife I'm not a great writer. I only have some education in technical writing and my work largely values getting to the point without the fluff.

So jumping topics without any transition at all, Github pages are pretty nice for spinning up basic sites. I've been using markdown for awhile to do what we call Tech Talks at my organization so this was familiar.

It doesn't have everything and I thought about doing something a little more complex. Maybe buy a domain, set up a hosted site, do some nicer styling and navigation. But then I decided I want this to be a more relaxing adventure.

And that's okay, casual games have their own merits.
