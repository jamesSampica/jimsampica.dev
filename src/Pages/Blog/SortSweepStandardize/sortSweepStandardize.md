# Sort Sweep Standardize
## 2021/04/01

I just finished the book [2 Second Lean: How to Grow People and Build a Fun Lean Culture](https://paulakers.net/books/2-second-lean)
and one idea I've incorporated into my daily habits is the _three s_ method. This method is a simplification of the _five s_ method of lean
manufacturing.

The book is about a company with more traditional manufacturing focus so I had to adapt the _three s_ method to be appropriate for my daily work.
Here's a few things I do every morning to organize myself for the day...

1. I apply sort, sweep, and standardize things to my physical desk. 
    - I make sure my mouse mat is properly placed for sitting at my desk.
    - Verify that the mouse and keyboard are at the right position and have enough "give" to the cords so I can move them freely.
    - Put my phone on the right side of my desk and plug it in if it needs charged.
    - Move my microphone to the correct position for talking over Slack or Zoom.
    - Remove any soda cans, mugs, or trash from the previous day
2. I apply sort, sweep, and standardize things to my virtual desk. 
    - Decide whether I need to keep files on my desktop or delete them. If I keep them I organize them into a projects folder
    - Empty the recycle bin
    - Close all browser windows. I find that starting fresh is easier than trying to come into the same thought pattern as the day previously
    - Delete git branches that are no longer relevant
    - Read all emails and delete anything unneeded. I will also unsubscribe from marketing spam or create folders for topics I want to receive

This takes me five to ten minutes and sets me up for the next 8-9 hours. I've reduced mental waste by not having to parse the noise of the previous day.
I feel more motivated and think clearer.

_Three S_ is a very easy practice to adopt and everyone should incorporate it into their work habits.
