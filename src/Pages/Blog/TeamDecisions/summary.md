# Letting the team decide (or not)
## 2021/06/09

Agile teams are _self-managing_. That is, collectively they figure out amongst themselves how the work will be done. When figuring out how to do the work the team adopts processes that members think will help them. The team is empowered to adopt and adapt their own processes because they are the closest to the work and thus are the best hope of efficiently creating and improving these processes.

This idea is not new, having its root in Lean Manufacturing decades ago. However, imprecise language has given teams the idea that _self-managing_ teams should do whatever "works for them". I think this language is mostly harmless but there can be a problem if interpreted a certain way.

A team valuing removing waste and improving outcomes will interpret this correctly to mean that silver bullet solutions don't work and the most efficient way of working will require constant inspection and adaption. On the other hand, a team not comfortable with each other, not empowered by management, or not motivated will arrive at a process (and stay there) that is comfortable and keeps the peace between team members.

For the latter team the members are content and they point to the standard of "working for us" and declare that no more improvements are necessary. Afterall, if everybody happy what is left to do? Well, a lot because self-management comes with accountability. The team is accountable for the product's success and creating productive parternships.

Fundamentally agile is about empiricism. Not just in ways that benefit the product but also in ways that benefit people interacting. The team who solely keeps the peace forgoes innovation on their products and their interactions with others. 

If the team expects to self-manage then they must understand the economics of development just as any manager must understand it. People and resources are not free. The team that doesn't attempt to combat their waste is dumping the cost of that waste onto the organization, stakeholders, and customers.

A related term of self-management is self-motivation. Teams must be empowered by the organization to self-manage **but** people must be self-motivated to self-manage. Without self-motivation teams will take the power of _self-management_ make others bear accountability for their decisions.

I think a lot of managers have run into these problems and the delighted thinkers of old haven't missed the opportunity to let everyone know.

But unfortunately to old-schoolers the answer isn't imposed hierarchy. 

The solution is simple(ish). Hire people who are motivated.
