# The "What if we didn't" game
## 2021/07/08

Every so often when I start feeling comfortable with the way I work I like to play a little game I call "What if I didn't".

I play a variant of this game (What if we didn't) with teams I'm on. Which reminds me maybe I should tell them about this...

Anyway...

The game is a thought exercise and the rules of this game are simple. We Take any process we currently do (or your team does) and ask what would happen if we didn't do it.

Then we think through all the outcomes we might expect when this process is removed from the whole process. An exhaustive list isn't necessary. Perhaps just the biggest things or the top three things that would have bad outcomes.

The second step and the magic part is then to take those bad outcomes and try to fix them something more efficient than what we had before. If we like what we've come up with then we discard the old process and adopt the new process.

Given that we're playing fast and loose with the "bad outcomes" and "efficiency" it may be the new process overlooked something or wasn't quite what we expected. At that point I either like to attempt to correct the new process or abandon it entirely.

Someone has probably already given a nice fancy name to something similar and I've just reinvented the wheel but I thought I'd share anyway.

One last note is that in my experience removing process is harder than adding it. Our emotions lead us to get comfortable with what we have and like to avoid new ways of doing things. Because of this, when introducing this game to a team it's important that people feel safety in the team's culture and environment.
