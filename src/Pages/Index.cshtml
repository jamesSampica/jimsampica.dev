        <p>Hi there. ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>My career's mission is helping organizations solve complex problems with practical solutions.</p>
        <p>I have been enjoying the Microsoft C#/.NET space for many years but love the craft more than any specific technology. Because of this I enjoy solving problems wherever and however they need solving.</p>
        <p>In my free time I can be found reading books on topics such as Lean, Agile, XP, and software design.</p>
