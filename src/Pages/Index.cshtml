<p class="lead">My mission is helping organizations solve complex problems with practical solutions.</p>
<p class="lead">I enjoy the Microsoft C#/.NET space but love the craft more than any specific technology. I make an impact by taking a holistic approach to solving problems.</p>
<p class="lead">In my free time I can be found reading books on system design, architecture, and other programming topics.</p>
